Random Name Generator

This program can generate random names. When run, it will randomly select a first name and last name from predefined lists and print out the full name.

Some key features:

Stores first names and last names in separate arrays (lists)

Uses a random number generator to pick a random index for the arrays

Concatenates the randomly selected first name and last name

Prints the full random name to the console

To use:

Define arrays containing first name and last name options

Use Math.random() to generate a random number

Use the random number to pick an index from each name array

Concatentate the selected first and last name

Print the full random name

This provides a simple way to generate name combinations from prepopulated name lists. It can be expanded to support different naming conventions or load name data from files. The random name generation could also be integrated into applications that require disposable identities like testing.
